Amazon Product Data Scraper
This is a Python script that scrapes product information from Amazon search listings. It collects data on all products in the search results, including some items not available through the official Amazon API.

The script performs sleep delays between requests to avoid triggering anti-bot detection mechanisms and automatically iterates through all pages of the search results.
